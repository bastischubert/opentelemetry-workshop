# 3.1. Introduction

For this third lab, we're letting you choose your own mission.

You can either:

- Troubleshoot an issue in production

- Enhance telemetry signals in _gameserver_

If you're not sure which you'd like to do, have a read of both of the docs and then decide!

Click to the next module to read about the troubleshooting mission.
