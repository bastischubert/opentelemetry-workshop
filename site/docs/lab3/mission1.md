# 3.1. Mission A: Troubleshoot

For this mission, we're letting you loose in our production environment. (Honestly!)

As well as running an observability company, we've begun to sell telescopes and other cosmic stargazing paraphernalia in a brand-new online store, all backed by microservices.

We've instrumented all of these services with OpenTelemetry instrumentation.

Before tackling the next lab, have a read through the architecture of the system.

## Understand the application

The application is based on the OpenTelemetry Demo, which is a microservice-based distributed system intended to illustrate the implementation of OpenTelemetry in a near real-world environment.



Your task for this lab is to use OpenTelemetry signals to find and troubleshoot two problems:

## Step 1: Get ready

All of the services are located in the `production` environment.

1.  In Grafana, open the menu and click on Application to open Application Observability.

## Problem: What's wrong with our services?

The product catalog service seems to be failing. Can you find out why?

Places you can look:

- :bulb: To gain an overview of the application, use the Service Map in Application Observability
